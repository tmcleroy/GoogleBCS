#GoogleBCS
=========

A web app which applies Google's PageRank algorithm to the task of ranking sports teams. The app has a web front-end with a Java back end. Teams are ranked by a custom implementation of Google's famous PageRank algorithm. This web app was created as a proof of concept to see how algorithmic ranking of sports teams compared to human assigned rankings such as those given by the BCS. There is currently no demo available for this project, additional information is furnishable on request.
